 * marker, both prefixed with the current test name and the `commandPrefix`
 * template. The original {@link CommandResult} is returned untouched so
 * callers keep the same contract as `runCommand`.
 * @function runAndReport
 * @memberOf module:utils
 * @template R - The output writer result type.
 * @param {string} command The command to execute, in `runCommand` syntax.
 * @param {SpawnOptionsWithoutStdio} [opts] Spawn options forwarded to
 * `runCommand` (e.g. `cwd`, `env`, `shell`).
 * @param {OutputWriterConstructor<R, StandardOutputWriter<R>, Error>}
 * [outputConstructor] Output writer factory forwarded to `runCommand`.
 * @param {TestReporter} reporter The reporter collecting the evidence entry.
 * @param {string} [commandPrefix] Template for the echoed command line prefix;
 * supports `{cwd}` interpolation. Defaults to `"{cwd} $ "`.
 * @param {...unknown} args Extra arguments forwarded to `runCommand`.
 * @return {CommandResult<R>} The command runner whose promise resolves or
 * rejects as usual, after the report entry is written.
 * @throws {Error} When the underlying command runner cannot be created.
